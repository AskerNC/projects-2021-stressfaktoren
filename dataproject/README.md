# Data analysis project

Group name: Stressfaktoren

Group members: Frederik Holland Wiese & Nicolaj Ellemose Petersen

Our data analysis project examines data about wages in Denmark for different regions and age groups in the time span 1992-2019.

The results of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This loads the dataset:
'DST wage.xlsx' which contains data from Danmarks statestik(dst): https://www.statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/default.asp?w=1920 

It is important to note that the wage variable used in the project refers to the variable Erhvervsindkomst(4+5+6) on the dst website. The wage varible thus includes not only actual wages but also business profit and remunerations.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no other installments.
