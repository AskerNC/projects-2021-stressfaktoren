# Model analysis project

Our project is titled Model project OLG. It solves two OLG models, one having a pay as you go system, the other having a fully funded system. They are solved both analytically and numerically, and the results between the two are then compared with different parameters. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
